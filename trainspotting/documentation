Choice of critical sections:
The first critical section is the track from (17,3) to (17,7) guarded by semaphore s1. 
The second critical section lies between (17,7) and (15,9) guarded by s3. 
The third critical section is the upper track between (15,9) and (4,9) guarded by semaphore s2. 
The fourth lies between (4,9) and (3,11) guarded by semaphore s4. The fifth lies between 
(3,11) and (18,11) guarded by semaphore s5. The sixth and final critical section is 
the crossing between the two tracks at (8,7) guarded by semaphore s6. 

Our solution works as follows; The trains have a default track on which the critical
sections lie. If the default track is already occupied, the train must either wait or choose 
another track. A train knows if a critical section is occupied or not by asking the semaphore associated 
with that critical section. When a train leaves a critical section it tells the semaphore 
associated with that section that it has just left, and therefore another train can enter. 

The sensors are placed as follows: at each station, each track, there is a sensor.
On each track leading into a critical section there is a sensor. Each train has an 
instance variable dir that keeps track of which direction it is going. The direction changes 
when the train reaches a station. When a train reaches a certain sensor its actions 
depend in part on its direction. In some cases, it will also depend on which sensor we 
activated previously. 

Let us call the upper station A, and the lower station B. Suppose a train is moving 
from A to B and hits the sensor at (13,7). It asks s3 if there are any available permits. 
If there is an available permit, then we take it, set the switch to the correct direction and 
the keep going. If there are none, then it stops and waits until a permit 
becomes available. It also releases the semaphore s6. If the train is moving in the other 
direction (i.e. from B to A), then it asks s6 if there are any available permits. 
If there is a permit available, then we take it and keep going. If no permit is available, 
then the train stops and waits until a permit becomes available. It also releases 
the semaphore s3. Note that all semaphores initially have one available permit, except 
s1 and s5 that start out with zero available permits, since the train start at the 
critical sections corresponding to s1 and s5. 

Now consider the situation around the sensor with coordinates (19,9). If a train is 
moving from A to B and the previous sensor was the sensor with coordinates (13,7), we 
release the semaphore s1. If the previous sensor was the sensor with coordinates 
(13,8) we do not need to release any semaphores. We ask s2 if any permits are available. 
If there is a permit available, we take it, set the switch at (15,9) to the right  
and keep going. If there is no permit available, we set switch at (15,9) to the left 
and take the lower track. If the train is moving from B to A the situation is similar.

Consider the sensor at station A with coordinates (13,3) (the sensor on the upper track). 
If the train arrives at A, having started from B, we stop and wait for 1-2 seconds, and 
then change direction and accelerate to the default speed. 

The maximal speed in this solution is 22. If we try to run the program with higher 
speeds the trains will not be able to stop fast enough when hitting a sensor that 
tells it stop.

We tested the solution by running the following bash script:

********************************************************************************

	java -cp bin Main "Lab1.map" 17 22 15 &
	java -cp bin Main "Lab1.map" 1 1 15 &

********************************************************************************

Running this for a couple of minutes without getting any collisions or other problems 
we conclude that our solution is correct with a maximum speed of 22.
